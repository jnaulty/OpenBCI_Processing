To use, open OpenBCI_GUI, SSVEP (stimulus), and client_openbci.
client_openbci is just a simple client that receives information from the OpenBCI gui. I am sure there are better ways of implementing this, but I found this a nice and easy way to grab the data without having to make major the main OpenBCI GUI processing sketch.

Things to do:
Pretty everything up.
Work on game engine more.
Add user input for game start, reset, etc.
